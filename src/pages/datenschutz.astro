    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>
      Your Name<br />
      Your Street 1<br />
      12345 Your City<br />
      Your Country<br />
      Email: <a href="mailto:your@email.com">your@email.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2. General Information</h2>
    <p>
      We process personal data only to the extent required to provide a
      functional website and our content and services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless another storage period is stated in this policy, data will remain
      stored until the purpose for processing no longer applies, unless legal
      retention obligations require longer storage.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Hosting and Server Log Files</h2>
    <p>
      When this website is accessed, our hosting provider processes technically
      required access data, in particular IP address, date and time, requested
      URL/file, referrer URL, browser type/version, and operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
      This processing is required to provide the website and ensure security and
      stability. Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is the
      secure and reliable operation of this website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recipient is our technical hosting provider (processor under Art. 28
      GDPR). Log files are generally stored only for a limited time and then
      deleted, unless longer retention is necessary to investigate security
      incidents.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Contact Form (Web3Forms)</h2>
    <p>
      If you use the contact form, the data you enter (name, email, message, and
      optional content details) is processed to handle your request.
    </p>
    <p>
      The form is provided through Web3Forms. Submitted data is transmitted to
      Web3Forms and forwarded to the configured recipient email address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR (handling a request) and, where consent is
      given in the form, Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. Consent can be revoked at any time
      with effect for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recipients are Web3Forms and technical service providers used by
      Web3Forms. Data may be transferred to third countries (including outside
      the EU/EEA). Where required, transfers are based on legal safeguards such
      as adequacy decisions or standard contractual clauses.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>5. Local Icon Files</h2>
    <p>
      The social media icons on the homepage are served as local SVG files from
      our own server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loading these icons does not cause an additional IP transfer to external
      icon CDN providers.
    </p>

    <h2>6. External Platform Links</h2>
    <p>
      This website contains links to external platforms (e.g., Spotify, Apple
      Music, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, SoundCloud). Simply visiting our
      website does not transfer data to these platforms. A connection is only
      established when you click a link.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>This website does not use marketing or tracking cookies.</p>
    <h2>8. Analytics (Vercel Analytics)</h2>
    <p>
      We use Vercel Analytics to measure website usage in aggregated form. Legal
      basis: Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in operating, analyzing, and
      improving this website).
    </p>
    <p>
      The processing is carried out by Vercel as the provider of analytics and
      hosting services.
    </p>
    <p>
      More information:

    <p>
      If consent-based technologies are introduced in the future, appropriate
      consent will be obtained beforehand according to applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Storage Duration</h2>
    <p>
      We store personal data only as long as required for the respective purpose
      or as required by legal retention periods. Afterwards, data is deleted or
      processing is restricted.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Obligation to Provide Data</h2>
    <p>
      Providing personal data is not legally required. However, without the
      fields marked as required in the contact form, your request cannot be
      processed.
    </p>

    <h2>11. No Automated Decision-Making</h2>
    <p>
      Automated decision-making, including profiling under Art. 22 GDPR, does
      not take place.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      You have the statutory rights to access (Art. 15 GDPR), rectification
      (Art. 16 GDPR), erasure (Art. 17 GDPR), restriction of processing (Art. 18
      GDPR), data portability (Art. 20 GDPR), and objection (Art. 21 GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
      If processing is based on consent, you can revoke your consent at any time
      with effect for the future (Art. 7(3) GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
      You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
      (Art. 77 GDPR), especially in your place of residence, place of work, or
      place of the alleged infringement.
